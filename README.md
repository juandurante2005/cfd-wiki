# Welcome to the CFD Wiki!

This is an ongoing project designed to make the process of learning CFD more manageable for future generations of SRT. Anybody can add to this and increase the pages to make a more comprehensive and ever-growing guide.


To add to the wiki:

Open the Wiki page and look for anywhere you would like to add. If a link is red, the file/page has not been created yet and can be created with a click. Blue links exist, but everything can be expanded on!

When linking a photo, use the format `![](url)`, where `url` is the address for the photo (can be a photo on the repo, a link, etc.).

To link to another file, or a file that you would like to create, use double square brackets in the form `[[filename]]`
