Welcome!

This is meant to be a sort of SRT "wiki" for all things CFD! Additions are welcome, but this is just an ongoing way to document our efforts/knowledge and make it easier for new members to start out on the process.

NOTE: This tutorial will be entirely done using STAR-CCM+ version 2302.0001 (18.02.010), as that is the most recent release currently available on HPRC as of 2023. STAR sims are **not** backwards-compatible, and any file opened and saved in a newer release will be completely unusable in any previous version.
